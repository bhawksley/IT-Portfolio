# IT portfolio
Welcome to my beginning IT learning portfolio!
I have been working as a service desk technician for 2 months and am starting to explore different areas of IT and want to document my progress as I study and practice at home.
## Initial Goals (08/11/2025)
- Create first PowerShell scripts
